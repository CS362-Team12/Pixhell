# Pixhell
Rogue-lite 2d Unity game inspired by Dante's 9 hells.

## Abstract:
Pixhell is a bullet-hell rogue-lite that challenges players to survive and conquer nine stages - the nine circles of Hell - combining fast-paced action and unique environments with a progression system that encourages experimentation across multiple runs. Players navigate through increasingly more difficult stages, collecting upgrades along the way to eventually defeat the Devil in the center of Hell.

## Goals:
We are creating a replayable rogue-lite bullet-hell game involving making it through the nine circles of Hell to eventually battle the Devil. The game will include meta-progression, different characters, weapons, and enemies. The goal is to provide users with an enjoyable experience of progression and discovery in a chaotic challenge.

## Build and Testing:
Please refer to documentation/Pixhell Developer Documentation for instructions on installing and running the developer version. Please note: Installation time for Unity and other libraries can take a very long time and require a somewhat powerful computer. 

## Running
Please refer to documentation/Pixhell User Documentation for insturction on installing and running the user version. This is our suggestion for testing. 

Note: Due to difficulites getting markdown images to show up in a reasonable amount of time, documentation is currently in PDF form. 

## Use Cases
-  Left clicking while controlling the character performs an attack
  - Implemented and working fully
- The player character's hitbox colliding with a map selection trigger and it takes them to the next map
  - Implemented and working fully
- The player enters a new stage or enters a boss fight (stage boss or final boss) and dynamic music starts
  - Fully Implmented and functional. Background music is dynamic based on game state
- The player completes the first level by defeating its final boss and the next arena is unlocked
  - This needs to be slightly adjusted on the doc, but this is hypothetically implemented
- The player collects enough EXP to level up and is allowed to select a new upgrade
  - Implemented and working fully
- Interact with the NPCs and have dialogue
  - Not Implemented and likely to be scrapped for a new Use Case
- Hitting shift while controlling the character causes the character to dodge roll
  - Implemented and working fully, but needs to be slightly changed to hitting "spacebar" instead of "shift"
