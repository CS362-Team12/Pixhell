## In Game Control (how to play the game):

  

### Loading into your first run

Upon loading into the game, the player will be presented with a “Start” and “Exit” button. Click the “Start” button to proceed to the Run Selection screen, which will look like this:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfwbdL83FJPfBv1Nv5MqbzORPAwucGdWnPNJjsfc6ixMJ6THV2yPRCBrKS4YFgDkksoEwMwdh9Wucdpo0eMhcuIU22Vt5UX75sgLu6Z4YEkbE1-VeCLlGtWeHEoy2dVsOffmAbG1A?key=a1F9Uwzb3Vq6qpBCf52FtqG5)

To begin playing the game, press the “Create” shown in the top right, which will create a fresh run file. This will be shown in the form of a clickable panel (shown on the right) that will load the player into the game. The panel shows information about the run save like the last time the player played that run, the highest arena that has been achieved, and the amount of money in the inventory. The player can also choose to delete this or any other run file at any time by simply clicking the “Delete” button shown in the bottom right of each panel.

Clicking the panel will load the player into the Character Selection screen.

### Choosing your character

Upon loading into the Character Selection screen, the player is presented with 3 character choices. They are the Warrior, Archer, and Mage. Each character has different attacks, special attacks, health, and damage. More information on the specifics is below.

Any of these characters can be chosen any time the player loads into a run, with no penalty for switching characters even mid run. If the player chooses to back out of a run to choose a different character, they are free to do so, and will maintain any progress they have made. To select a character, simply press the “Select <Character” button on the bottom of each of the panels. This will load the player into the lobby, also known as Limbo.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd5r2uwsQo-wQbu-1PIK1aWQw9auwAFASzlUKFifgkGfdoJdVcq9oVF-ZAU8-F3Bu2Age7fhXF61WWrmPPJomC2nT1kX20MWLtVbRSfrU9adP4fwNcsckov1aVNk_r8Jq9TgcIB?key=a1F9Uwzb3Vq6qpBCf52FtqG5)

### Limbo

  

Limbo is the lobby for Pixhell. Inside are portals for each arena, and a clickable item shop icon (shown right). The portals are the access point for each arena, with the left portal in the image taking the player to Lust, which is the first arena when walked on. Portals are colored in red when locked, and turn blue once unlocked. In order to unlock an arena, the one directly before it must be completed. For instance, the player must complete the Lust arena before moving on to the Gluttony arena.

  

### Item Shop![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfPwFKQayXQ57d_sz_kqvkvKED4o6II6pphX9_OyEefEz5blXgRbESlkaYj0Xb_-ZTrhqA8w7uFdxorm1G5_9YV-IzV_EIlHvv_VYpt2OYhd9-uXXb9jiwUdOQWKV2kFCE8iqcoww?key=a1F9Uwzb3Vq6qpBCf52FtqG5)

The item shop is the clickable house icon located in the image above. The item shop is crucial to progression, as it allows players to purchase upgrades for their characters that are permanent. Items are purchased with coins dropped by enemies in the arenas. To purchase an item, click on any of the icons shown in the center panel, and then click the “Purchase” button shown on the right. This will put the item in the player’s inventory (assuming the player has enough coins to purchase the item). Purchasable items are shown to have a white background, while items that are already owned have a grey background. Players can also choose to sell their existing items for a full refund on coins.

  

### Player HUD![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdrWbATxSKfaBqn6CCYecK1wUYDhM9O_rCWUBRXVJy0jYWf_vbWId2UrWMlF5x_g_WaTBlSdgMqGsJ9PEVvN1YUxzyAX3ULpCx5iILHi7v1MKjuSTzyVMDqGtt6-s02VLkwR6LsFQ?key=a1F9Uwzb3Vq6qpBCf52FtqG5)

When in an arena, players have icons shown on the screen giving information about their character.

-   Top Left: Experience - Once full, choose an upgrade from 3 displayed
    
-   Top Right: Health - If health runs out, you will die and have to restart the arena
    
-   Bottom Left: Ability cooldowns, this shows how long until an ability with a cooldown can be used again
    
-   Bottom right: Coin count: The number of coins obtained that can be used to buy items from the item shop
    

  
  

### Gameplay![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe0kIh2mzESQLQYAOAZKcJ4X6U4KpXGi5mSEt5-wFXTPAVdqixTIdoxKkUeBLShbHNyzDmT9QjOZrcp6aykS298NmtuCPtlnXFtYHfMhCCWxBIMSMtE13GIY0ASFkiD74wAyqLW?key=a1F9Uwzb3Vq6qpBCf52FtqG5)

Each arena consists of multiple waves of enemies, that each get progressively harder than the last. The player will only move on to the next wave in an arena once all of the enemies from the previous one have been defeated. The final wave of each arena consists of a final boss that must be defeated to complete the arena. The player must complete every wave without dying in order to win.

Along the way, enemies will drop experience orbs that can be picked up. Once the experience bar (shown top left) is full, the player will be presented with the upgrade screen, which allows the player to choose from 3 random upgrades. These upgrades only last for the current arena attempt, and will disappear once the player returns to the lobby. Each upgrade requires more experience than the last, so as the arena progresses it becomes more difficult to get upgrades.
