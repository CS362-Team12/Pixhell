# Team Report

### Previous Goals

* Continue adding functionality to the start menu  
  * Make an options page that controls audio, resolution and similar items  
  * Begin work on lobby functionality  
    * Make it so the player can walk up to a spot in the lobby and it will give them the option to load an arena  
* Work on getting basic enemies in game (or delegate the task to someone else)

### Progress and Issues

* Created a start menu with a start, options, and exit button 
  * The start button takes the user directly to a run selection screen  
* Began implementing a run selection screen where users can select a given save they wish to play, or create a new run to begin playing
    * Within this, a backend file system that stores player data to pull saves from was needed, so began working on that (was not on this week's goal)
        * Progress on this specific feature was slower than expected due to UI bugs when trying to get the saves to load onto the scrollable menu screen

### Goals

* Complete the run selection screen and link it to the lobby screen when clicking on a run
* Complete the player data save system which will allow storage of player items and level progression as well
* Create a single portal for the player to interact with which will take them to an arena
