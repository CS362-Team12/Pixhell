# Product Description

## Title \- Pixhell

## Abstract: 

## Pixhell is a bullet-hell rogue-lite that challenges players to survive and conquer nine stages \- the nine circles of Hell \- combining fast-paced action and unique environments with a progression system that encourages experimentation across multiple runs. Players navigate through increasingly more difficult stages, collecting upgrades along the way to eventually defeat the Devil in the center of Hell.

## Goal: 

## We are creating a replayable rogue-lite bullet-hell game involving making it through the nine circles of Hell to eventually battle the Devil. The game will include meta-progression, different characters, weapons, and enemies. The goal is to provide users with an enjoyable experience of progression and discovery in a chaotic challenge.

## Current Practice:

There are many examples of games similar to ours that we are taking inspiration from which use many different game engines, one of which is Unity which we will be using. This allows us to skip some of the heavy lifting and let Unity manage it. However, it constrains us to the bounds of Unity which limits us within its jurisdiction, and we have to worry about the performance issues of running a game on computers with limited hardware. 

## Novelty:

The thematic structure of combining a narrative like the Nine Circles of Hell with the action and tight mechanics of a bullet-hell roguelike creates a more immersive and stylistic experience. Navigating a symbolic descent while the difficulty escalates makes for a memorable gaming venture.

## Effects:

Games are a huge source of fun and a way for people to escape from their regular lives for a few hours at a time. We hope to make it so people can delve into the world of Pixhell and lose themselves in enjoyment and even learn a little bit about Dante's circles of hell.

## Technical Approach: 

We will be using Unity to implement this project, and GitHub for version control. C\# scripting will be used for game logic and mechanics, and Unity’s built-in editor for building arenas and enemies. External software such as Piskel for animating and pixel art, Ableton for music, and Freesound for other sound effects will be used on the artistic side.

## Risks

Our greatest potential risk would be picking a project that is far too large for our group size. Other potential risks include meshing everyone’s work while maintaining a clear and effective theme/style for the project. To help combat these issues, we will prioritize frequent and honest communication that focuses on work quality and open communication. Aside from this, we will set clear checkpoints for each weekly meeting, this will help us not only keep pace but check our goals to see how realistic our goals are.

## Main Goals:

* Eight arenas of increasing difficulty, with one mini-boss and a final boss. Beating the final boss of an arena unlocks the next one. The ninth and final arena is a single final boss  
* The lobby area provides progressive upgrades that make future runs easier by improving player abilities and unlocking new features  
* During each arena, temporary powers and abilities are applied to the character to mix up gameplay  
* There are at least 3 distinct characters which each provide a unique and enjoyable gameplay experience

## Stretch Goals:

* Art and effects match the theme and have continuity with one another, and are implemented smoothly  
* Implement sound design to make the game pop, both through sound effects and music  
* Add in-depth lore and story element
