### Previous Goals

* Implement half a dozen enemies (excluding the animations)
    * Will include adding new attacks and movements like homing, AOE attack, teleporting
    * Will also utilize existing attacks
* Create playable spawn scripts for all of the arenas we end up having
* Implement more items to make character progression more balanced
* Limit number of runs to 3, possibly remove slider on RunSelect screen
* Create test script for PlayerController class to test item upgrades automatically
* Make portals dynamiclly update based on the player's max level, so the player cannot just enter any level at any time, and must beat one before moving onto the next
* Fix logic error in wave spawning that leaves random pauses at the end of levels
* Fix issue where enemies can spawn outside the map
