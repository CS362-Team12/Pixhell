# Pixhell
Rouge-lite 2d Unity game inspired by Dante's 9 hells.

## Abstract:
Pixhell is a bullet-hell rogue-lite that challenges players to survive and conquer nine stages - the nine circles of Hell - combining fast-paced action and unique environments with a progression system that encourages experimentation across multiple runs. Players navigate through increasingly more difficult stages, collecting upgrades along the way to eventually defeat the Devil in the center of Hell.

## Goals:
We are creating a replayable rogue-lite bullet-hell game involving making it through the nine circles of Hell to eventually battle the Devil. The game will include meta-progression, different characters, weapons, and enemies. The goal is to provide users with an enjoyable experience of progression and discovery in a chaotic challenge.
